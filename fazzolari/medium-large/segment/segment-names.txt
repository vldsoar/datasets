Image Segmentation data set

1: Description.

This database contains instances drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images (classes). The images were handsegmented to create a classification for every pixel. Each instance encodes a 3x3 region. 

The task is to determine the type of surface of each region. 

Attributes description: 

1. Region-centroid-col: the column of the center pixel of the region. 
2. Region-centroid-row: the row of the center pixel of the region. 
3. Region-pixel-count: the number of pixels in a region = 9. 
4. Short-line-density-5: the results of a line extractoin algorithm that counts how many lines of length 5 (any orientation) with low contrast, less than or equal to 5, go through the region. 
5. Short-line-density-2: same as short-line-density-5 but counts lines of high contrast, greater than 5. 
6. Vedge-mean: measure the contrast of horizontally adjacent pixels in the region. There are 6, and this is the mean value. This attribute is used as a vertical edge detector. 
7. Vegde-sd: the contrast of horizontally adjacent pixels in the region. There are 6, and this is the standard deviation. This attribute is used as a vertical edge detector. 
8. Hedge-mean: measures the contrast of vertically adjacent pixels. Used for horizontal line detection (mean) 
9. Hedge-sd: measures the contrast of vertically adjacent pixels. Used for horizontal line detection (standard deviation) 
10. Intensity-mean: the average over the region of (R + G + B)/3 
11. Rawred-mean: the average over the region of the R value. 
12. Rawblue-mean: the average over the region of the B value. 
13. Rawgreen-mean: the average over the region of the G value. 
14. Exred-mean: measure the excess red: (2R - (G + B)) 
15. Exblue-mean: measure the excess blue: (2B - (G + R)) 
16. Exgreen-mean: measure the excess green: (2G - (R + B)) 
17. Value-mean: 3-d nonlinear transformation of RGB (see James D. Foley and Andries Van Dam. 1982. Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics. Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA) 
18. Saturatoin-mean: (see James D. Foley and Andries Van Dam. 1982. Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics. Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.) 
19. Hue-mean: (see James D. Foley and Andries Van Dam. 1982. Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics. Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA.)
