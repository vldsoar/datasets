German Credit data set

1: Description.

A numerical version of the Statlog German Credit Data data set. Here, the task is to clasify customers as good (1) or bad (2), depending on 20 features about them and their bancary accounts.

In this problem, the use of an additional cost matrix is suggested, because it is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad (cost 5), than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good (cost 1). 

2: Type.			Classification	
3: Origin.			Real world
4: Instances.		1000
5: Features.		20
6: Classes.			2	
7: Missing values.	No
