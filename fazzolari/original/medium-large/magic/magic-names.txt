MAGIC Gamma Telescope data set

1: Description.

This data set contains generated data to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. 

The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in: D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998). 

The task is to discriminate statistically images generated by primary gammas (signal, class label g) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background, class label h). 

Attribute information:
